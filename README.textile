h1. Image resizing ans square cropping library

Image resizing and cropping can take up a lot of repetitive code. Here's an image library that I use to create thumbs and resized versions of images (square or not). By default, images are squared from the center, but this can be offset.

If you have any additions or sugegstions, feel free to code somethings up and send me a pull request!

h1. Contents

* A default CI 2.0 installation.
* The library.
* A controller with some example code.

If you wish to try it out - just drop the entire contents intro a web folder, make sure folder /gfx is writable and fire op your browser.

h1. Installation

Just drop application\libraries\Images.php intro your library folder and you're good to go.

h1. Typical usage

pre. function image ()
{
    $newWidth = 200;
    $newHeight = 200;
    $enlargeOnResize = FALSE;
    $sourcefile = FCPATH . 'gfx/rooney.jpg';
    $destinationfile = FCPATH . 'gfx/';
    $this->load->library('images');
    
    // Create square and resized image example
    $this->images->squareThumb($sourcefile, $destinationfile . 'tn1_rooney.jpg', $newWidth, $enlargeOnResize);
    
    // Create resized image example
    $this->images->resize($sourcefile, $destinationfile . 'tn2_rooney.jpg', $newWidth, $newHeight, $enlargeOnResize);
    
    // Create square image image
    $this->images->square($sourcefile, $destinationfile . 'tn3_rooney.jpg');
}
